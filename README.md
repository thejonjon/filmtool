# filmtool
A tool I tossed together to assist with filming. It is a ticker/timer which you can run in tandem it filming to create timestamp marks, and submarks to help document longer takes. It outputs a CSV file with the log of filming. Uses Python 2.7 with pyQT4.

To Do
------------
- Proved more of a hastle then benifit in its initial version. Have a few dozen up ease of use updates to make.
- Create easier click to mark in and out pre-programmed segements
- Allow customizeable text file that can be loaded in as an itinerary.
- Allow comments for marks and submarks to be made POST starting the mark.
- Have some default buttons since typing while filming is picked up in my simple studio.
- Output subtitle file as well as CSV so when reviewing footage, subtitles with notes can be loaded in.
- Allow a config seeting in the CSV that can be modified after file is generated to adjust for delayed or premature sync
- Create directories for filming so CSV name #s corrispond with GoPro video IDs
- Remove "Sequence Name" Instead when making a new series can choose a global name, and sequence names will be #s
